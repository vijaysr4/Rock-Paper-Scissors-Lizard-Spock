“I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough,
75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well,
here is a slight variation that reduces that probability. 
This version is also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives.”\

The logic:

- Scissors cuts Paper.
- Paper covers Rock.
- Rock crushes Lizard.
- Lizard poisons Spock.
- Spock smashes Scissors.
